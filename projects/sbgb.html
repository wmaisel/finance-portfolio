        <h2>What We Did</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Between October 2025 and January 2026, I had the pleasure of acting as Engagement Manager on CYC's engagement with Santa Barbara Gift Baskets. During this project, I led a team of 5 incredible business analysts, and together we assisted founder and owner Anne Pazier in identifying and approaching areas of declining performance for the business. Santa Barbara Gift Baskets is a locally based gourmet gifting business known for its curated products and community reputation. While the business had shown a strong client base, overall consistent performance, and unique identity, it also faces challenges related to seasonal demand, owner-dependent operations, and revenue fluctuations. SBGB is currently moving toward a sale, and to best position itself for a prompt transition, we wanted to present SBGB to potential buyers as a compelling, low-risk investment with clear pathways for growth.</p>

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        <p>After we met with Anne for our Scoping Meeting, we identified several areas for improvement, and broke up each broad area into several actionable work-streams.</p>
